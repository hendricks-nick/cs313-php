            Nick enjoys a lot of different activities. From delving into the Discworld
            of Terry Pratchett's books, binge watching The Big Bang Theory or playing
            games with friends and family, he is always entertained.

            Baseball is not only America's favorite past time activity, but Nicks as well.
            It started back in the late 90's as the Arizona Diamondbacks become the next
            expansion team to join the MLB. They went on to win the 2001 world series, being the
            fastest expansion team to ever win the world series. The 7th game in particular
            was a nail biter. Down 2-1 in the bottom of the 9th inning, facing Mariano Rivera,
            one of the greatest pitchers of our time, they came back to win 3-2 with only 1 out.
